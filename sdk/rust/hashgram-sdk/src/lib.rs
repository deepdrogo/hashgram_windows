//! The Hashgram client SDK.
//!
//! Everything a native application needs to be a Hashgram client, in one
//! crate with no UI: identity and keys, the wallet, end-to-end encrypted
//! messaging, public social events, media, and the network link to reach
//! nodes. Swift, Kotlin, TypeScript and C# bindings are expected to wrap
//! this crate (or reimplement it against the same protobuf definitions and
//! signing vectors) rather than reimplement the cryptography.
//!
//! # Trust model, in one paragraph
//!
//! The SDK trusts the chain for who owns what (addresses, devices, names)
//! and for balances. It trusts nobody for content: blobs are hash-verified,
//! social events are signature-verified against on-chain devices, messages
//! are authenticated by MLS. Nodes are interchangeable providers of
//! availability; the SDK talks to several and drops any that serves bad
//! bytes. Nothing here can be told "trust this node" by a node.
//!
//! # Layers
//!
//! **Hashgram One application layer** (what a client program calls):
//!
//! | Module | Does |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | [`app`] | [`app::HashgramOne`] facade: opens the account, connects, exposes the APIs below |
//! | [`mail`] | HashMail: send/receive/thread/file E2EE mail |
//! | [`drive`] | HashDrive: encrypted files, folders, versions, sharing |
//! | [`people`] | Lookup, contact requests, friends, blocks, profiles |
//! | [`feed`] | Public posts/comments/reactions, chronological feeds |
//! | [`circles`] | Private groups over MLS |
//! | [`spaces`] | Shared environments with roles (signed event log) |
//! | [`devices`] | Multi-device reconciliation and bootstrap |
//! | [`sync`] | The sync engine state machine |
//! | [`wallet`] | Balances, send, stake, usernames |
//! | [`provider`] | Earn: provider lifecycle and earnings |
//! | [`network`] | Peers, validators, supply, indexer read model |
//! | [`store`] | Encrypted local store |
//! | [`ai`] | Hash AI interfaces (no implementation transmits anything) |
//!
//! **Protocol layer** (what the application layer is built on):
//!
//! | Module | Does |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | [`account`] | Encrypted vault; wallet, root and device keys; on-chain identity |
//! | [`link`] | libp2p client swarm with the Hashgram handshake |
//! | [`messaging`] | MLS groups over store-and-forward mailboxes |
//! | [`social`] | Signed social events |
//! | [`blob`] | Upload, download, verify, private encryption |
//! | [`chain_relay`] | Chain reads/broadcast through the P2P relay, cross-checked |

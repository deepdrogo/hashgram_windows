//! How a [`crate::Client`] reaches the chain.
//!
//! Two transports exist. The original one is HTTP to a REST gateway
//! (`http://127.0.0.1:1317` on a node, or an HTTPS endpoint an operator
//! publishes). The second is the P2P chain relay: allow-listed reads and
//! broadcast carried over `/hashgram/rpc/1` by the same nodes a client
//! already talks to, implemented in `hashgram-sdk` on top of its `Link` and
//! plugged in here through [`ChainTransport`]. The client code above the
//! transport — balances, sequences, signing, broadcast, polling — is the
//! same either way.
//!
//! A transport reports what it can and cannot do. The relay cannot run
//! `simulate` (it executes transactions against the gateway, so nodes do not
//! forward it); the client then estimates gas instead. The relay also knows
//! which peers served an answer and whether they agreed; HTTP knows nothing
//! of the kind and reports `None`.
